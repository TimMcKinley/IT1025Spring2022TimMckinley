## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

### Information System Components
### The first component would be hardware, This refers to the physical device that you are making a purchase on and the physical server that the Amazon information is stored on
###  The second component would be software, this refers to the Amazon app you are using on your device as well as the function of the payment method being processed by a bank. This creates a user friendly experience when on Amazons website allowing for an interface to provide all of the items you need.
### The third component would be data, this is all of the information stored on the physical amazon server, including items up for sale, pricing, number of users, and much more. This allows the website to display how many of one item is in stock and the estimated shipping time of said item.
### People is the fourth component, obviously without this component there would be no one to buy the product or update the website when the time comes. People can refer to the actual consumers using the website. Or the developers working to make the space more user friendly.
### Process being the final piece of the puzzle, the process essentially takes the information you have such as ip ect, sends it to amazon and the website responds back. This allows you to look at items on the website and for them to save your account for easy future shopping. After you want to purchase an item, the website allows you to enter payment method which is then sent to amazon and finally the bank for verification. After this said process your item will be shipped and will arrive according to the websites said date. All of the previous components tie into this process accordingly.
### Software
#### GitHub
#### Screen Capture
### The software used to screen capture my work is native to Windows OS, The software is windows snipping tool and it is used to essentially cut an image out of the current screen you are on. The name of my file is ScreenCapture. The file size is 45.7 kb, and the software association is a PNG. This is a type of extension that most images uses and it is a file that windows can natively read. 
#### Application, Utility, and Operating Systems
#### Starting with application software, this type of software is used to accomplish a goal, for example excel would allow a user to create a chart that displays data in a way they want it too. This allows users who have this application to create charts, not only being limited to excel, Google is another, this allows people to find and use information rather than traditioal book reading. Utility software is used for maintenece in a sense, these programs have an inteded use such as virus protection or file management, a good example would be WebRoot. This software scans any downloads before you aquire it locally and tell you if it is a threat or not. Operating systems are the most important part of a computer, this is what allows all of the programs you download to communicate as well as providing the interface to manuever through your computer. This software commonly used is Windows and this allows users to get access to many differnt types of software and applications for many uses.
#### ERP 
#### ERP stands for Enterprise Resource Planning. This software is used for companies to store large amounts of data that can be accessed anywhere. For example amazons ERP software would list their total sales and profits for a certain time period. This is important software for companies to have so they can look back on previous years and continue to grow on what they already acheived.
#### Virtualization
#### Virtualization is essentially using resources that arent directly related to ones hardware. This allows you to have multiple servers all with their own individual data on them act as one. This solves the problem of being bound to hardware. Virtual machines are another example of Virtualization. Say you were at work and you forgot to run a program you needed to access on your personal computer. Remoting into the computer gives you full access to it and its resources while being in another physical location. This also allows for increased security being able to monitor multiple devices from any given location or user. HyperVisors are used to seperate physical resources from the virtual environment. This software is used to divide physical resource among multiple devices. For example multiple servers. Each of them need a hypervisor so a central point can use them to their potential.
#### Python
#### Python is a very simle coding laguage using mostly english as its form of code. This allows for very simple programming allowing for more attention on problem solving rather than other forms of syntax and structure. Interpretated laguage will execute commands without previous software telling it what the command means. Compiled language requires a program that specifies what each line of code means and how to execute it.
