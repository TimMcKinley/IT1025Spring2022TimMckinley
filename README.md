## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

### Information System Components
### The first component would be hardware, This refers to the physical device that you are making a purchase on and the physical server that the Amazon information is stored on
###  The second component would be software, this refers to the Amazon app you are using on your device as well as the function of the payment method being processed by a bank. This creates a user friendly experience when on Amazons website allowing for an interface to provide all of the items you need.
### The third component would be data, this is all of the information stored on the physical amazon server, including items up for sale, pricing, number of users, and much more. This allows the website to display how many of one item is in stock and the estimated shipping time of said item.
### People is the fourth component, obviously without this component there would be no one to buy the product or update the website when the time comes. People can refer to the actual consumers using the website. Or the developers working to make the space more user friendly.
### Process being the final piece of the puzzle, the process essentially takes the information you have such as ip ect, sends it to amazon and the website responds back. This allows you to look at items on the website and for them to save your account for easy future shopping. After you want to purchase an item, the website allows you to enter payment method which is then sent to amazon and finally the bank for verification. After this said process your item will be shipped and will arrive according to the websites said date. All of the previous components tie into this process accordingly.
### Software
#### GitHub
#### Screen Capture
### The software used to screen capture my work is native to Windows OS, The software is windows snipping tool and it is used to essentially cut an image out of the current screen you are on. The name of my file is ScreenCapture. The file size is 45.7 kb, and the software association is a PNG. This is a type of extension that most images uses and it is a file that windows can natively read. 
#### Application, Utility, and Operating Systems
#### Starting with application software, this type of software is used to accomplish a goal, for example excel would allow a user to create a chart that displays data in a way they want it too. This allows users who have this application to create charts, not only being limited to excel, Google is another, this allows people to find and use information rather than traditioal book reading. Utility software is used for maintenece in a sense, these programs have an inteded use such as virus protection or file management, a good example would be WebRoot. This software scans any downloads before you aquire it locally and tell you if it is a threat or not. Operating systems are the most important part of a computer, this is what allows all of the programs you download to communicate as well as providing the interface to manuever through your computer. This software commonly used is Windows and this allows users to get access to many differnt types of software and applications for many uses.
#### ERP 
#### ERP stands for Enterprise Resource Planning. This software is used for companies to store large amounts of data that can be accessed anywhere. For example amazons ERP software would list their total sales and profits for a certain time period. This is important software for companies to have so they can look back on previous years and continue to grow on what they already acheived.
#### Virtualization
#### Virtualization is essentially using resources that arent directly related to ones hardware. This allows you to have multiple servers all with their own individual data on them act as one. This solves the problem of being bound to hardware. Virtual machines are another example of Virtualization. Say you were at work and you forgot to run a program you needed to access on your personal computer. Remoting into the computer gives you full access to it and its resources while being in another physical location. This also allows for increased security being able to monitor multiple devices from any given location or user. HyperVisors are used to seperate physical resources from the virtual environment. This software is used to divide physical resource among multiple devices. For example multiple servers. Each of them need a hypervisor so a central point can use them to their potential.
#### Python
#### Python is a very simle coding laguage using mostly english as its form of code. This allows for very simple programming allowing for more attention on problem solving rather than other forms of syntax and structure. Interpretated laguage will execute commands without previous software telling it what the command means. Compiled language requires a program that specifies what each line of code means and how to execute it.
#### File names Python1 and Python2 are quick examples of how the programming language works. Simple text is interpreted as a command
#### Graphic Modeling and Rendering Vector images are digital art and shapes created by a formula, where as raster images are composed of many pixels.
Lossy files are not good for web developers because they can lose data when being saved, loseless ensures that all the data is saved in its original form
GIFs can be animated. JPEGs are good for retaining color and variety of color saturation, PNGs are for images that need sharp contrast.
#### File Compression
The purpose of file compression is to take large groups of files and "compress" them into a folder to use up less room. This allows for more storage without needing access to the file. When you do need access you have to unzip the file.
My file uncompressed was 12.5kb, when compressed the file only uses about 2kb. I expect the differential would be much more for a jpeg considering that jpegs take up more storage. 
#### Artificial Intelligence

### Career Exploration
#### Bureau of Labor Statistics  I found that the average pay for Computer Hardware Engineers is around 58$ per hour, They design and test computer components.
#### Handshake I found many internships that involve computer hardware, this website allows me to find many coops for furthering my degree and experience
#### Certifications, Certificates, and Degrees I think that certifications are an amazing way to represent your knowledge in a certain field. The certifications are an essential way to help obtain more knoweledge as well. The certification I would be interested in is CCNA or Comptia, these certs help show that you have extensive knowledge in the general operation and repair of computers as well as other related devices.

#### Industry Associations and Student Organizations I think the Cybersecurity club would be an amazing way to gain and share knowledge with others on how to operate a computer and keep others devices running safely. This club goes into detail on the internet security side of things and this would be great information to have for my degree.
### Computer Architecture
#### CPU The CPU is the brains of the computer, thiks cpu allows us to be able to create inputs and solve problems to then create an output that we can see. The CPU and ALUs relationship is that the CPU is meant to handle instructions and commands, where as the ALU is the one carrying out the actual math or problem solving. The CPU however is required first to instruct the ALU.
#### Gates and Circuits The truth table is essentially a list of all of the values that a operation can use. Top row of the table will represent variables and different combinations, as the table goes on the combinations get increasingly difficult.
The difference between an AND gate and an OR gate is that the AND gate gives true outputs when both inputs are considered true. The OR gate gives a true output if only one of the inputs are true.
#### IEEE The Institute of Electrical and Electronics engineers purpose is to create a better environment for those that use technology for our own benefit, their ethics limit people planning to use the internet for malintent. This is essentially an internet saftey organization that is dedicated to using the internet in a humane way than can create solutions and benefits to everyone who uses it.
#### Storage Latency is the time that the storage device has to wait before it can read the data, this latency is the time before a storage procedure can be accomplished. Transfer rate is the speed of which the data being read can be received by other devices in the computer such as the CPU. 
Solid state hard drives are superior to traditional drives. There is no moving parts therefore creating much less latency with a faster transfer rate. SSDs are more expensive but worth it if you want a faster machine. 
#### Memory Increasing ram is a way to make your machine faster, this ram is Volatile meaning that the information stored on it isnt kept when the machine loses power. This ram is used as a short term storage device for applications, giving your system more access to this ram means that it has more storage for its data, ram also runs at a much faster rate than hard drives do. Therefore ram is used for these applications to have quick access to that data. 
32 bit paths can only access a very little amount of RAM about 4gb, whereas 64 bit can access a substantial amount more. This 64 bit path creates ram that is much faster and has access to an abundance of it if the computer has it. 
Ram is volatile while HDDs are not meaning that on a hard drive data is retained. Data on ram can be accessed much faster than an HDD therefore making it better for applications to run smoothly.
#### Data Representation Decimals are based off of the number 10, this allows for tenth parts and powers of 10, Binary is mathematical useage of 1 and 2, therefore making it very easy for a computer to read and calculate vs decimal. Hexidecimal is a base 16 these represent 4 bit binary sequences that use 0-9 and A-F 
198 To binary is simple, divide by 2 and take the remainders of each if not evenly divisable those are equal to 1, for example 3/2 is not a whole number therefore 1 is the answer, If 4/2 is 2 then none is left over making it 0.
Binary to decimal is as simple as multiplying each digit to the corresponding power of 2. This gives you a pattern of numbers that you add and then that is your decimal number.
#ab0fff This color would be problematic because it is impossible to read on this because it is very bright. This would be hard to interpret data on that color or using that color. The readability of this color should be considered, it is easier to read darker colors such as black. 
#### Operating Systems Going into the Command prompt using the command mkdir directory_IT1025Folder to create a directory on my desktop. 

### Networking
#### Data Transmission 
#### Hardware
#### Topologies and Types of Networks
#### Protocols
IP address - An Ip is essentially a devices own name that is used to identify it on a internet or network. Ipv4 vs IPv6 is mostly dependent on address size, IPV4 uses a 32 bit address and IPV6 uses a 128 bit hexadecimal
ICANN - Is responsible for maintaining security of the namespaces on the internet, This gives security that your IP is protected.
HTTP - Is used for transfering documents from one to another, this allows for web servers and web browsers to communicate. HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 are protocols HTTP uses to ensure your data is secure while still allowing the browser and server to talk to each other.

### Cybersecurity and Encryption
#### Security Triad The first being confidentiality, this is a huge part of medicine nowadays, everything about you whether it be sensitive information or not is meant to be confidential. No one can release your information but you. This creates a safe feeling for those seeking help in the medical world. Integrity is knowing that the systems keeping together that confidential information are going to hold up. This overall contributes to the saftey of our file systems keeping our medical records safe such as MyChart. Finally availalabillity, This is making sure that the systems are fully protected but retially available when the person needs them. This contributes to the infrastructure of our medical file keeping systems.
#### Caesar and Polyalphabetic Ciphers While doing this part "Ayp-J ohz h Jfilyzljbypaf Jlyapmpjhal." is encrypted into ceasars ciper. Caesars cipher is a concept of encrypting language by using shifitng, each letter used is replaced by a letter slighlty furhter in the alphabet. This allows for messages to be encrypted with no way of telling what it is until decoded. Polyalphabetic encryption uses multiple substitution to encrypt messages.
#### Public and Private Key Encryption
#### Brute-Force Attacks

### Internet Programming
#### Components of a URL
Scheme - HTTPS   Domain - WWW.amazon.com    Top level domain - .edu    default page - result of a search   parameters - no file path anchor - specific location on a page. 
#### World Wide Web Consortium 
Tim Berners-Lee was the creator of W3C, the role of this was to create standards for the internet to improve security and reassurance of data safety and improve the quality of the web.
HTML - This standard is important because it is a language that all our computers use, this is used to create web pages, surf the web, develop games and so many more, that is why it is so important.

### Software Development
#### Algorithms
#### Object Oriented Concepts
The attributes of the shark class are the two sharks
The methods of the shark class are swimming and being awesome.
The constructer is used to initialize the methods of the class.
A object is a collection of data, where as a class is where all of the details about that object are stored.
This means to create an object.
    sammy = Shark("Sammy") and     def __init__(self, name): were used to instantiate the objects.
    Where one class takes the attributes and methods that the other class uses.
    **UML** My diagram shows the process of calling the sharks and the code needed to create a class.
    
    





### Database Systems
#### SQL, NoSQL, and Big Data Technologies
SQL and noSql, SQL can be scaled vertically where as noSQL is horizontal.
Velocity- Is the speed at which data is created and transported.
Veracity- The accuracy and reliablility of data
Volume- The shear amount of data
Variety - The different types of data being stored.

#### Data and Business Decisions
Better database allows for a more tailored experience for customers
Creates better inventory accuarcy 
Respond and understand to outlier events


#### The Relational Model and Normalization
Alot of traffic could be from foreign countries so it is essential that data can be recieved even if it is not in english
#### SQL Injections

### Legal and Ethical Responsibilities in Computing
The purpose of this being created is to give credit where credit is due, you may not use others resources without authorization and or citing your work. ACM uses this to create a motivaitonal guide for people looking to be computer professionals or that already are one.
It is important because someone else could steal your information and copyright it for themselves therefore denying you credit.
COPPA - This keeps children under 13 protected on certain sites.
FERPA - THis allows parents access to there childrens education records 
HIPPA -HIPPA is used to protect medical information about a patient, none of there info shall be disclosed to anyone unless consented by said patient.
